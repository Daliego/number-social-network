# Twitter Replication with Numerical Replies

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of Twitter but with a twist: users can only reply to posts with numbers, and each reply must include a sum of the numbers present in the original tweet. The project focuses on creating a simplified version of the Twitter platform where the interaction revolves around numbers and arithmetic.

## Challenges Faced

- **Time**: The project could not be completed within the 48-hour. Most of the features were not finished, everything is just in 50%.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Despite the limitations, I made sure to showcase my coding abilities by focusing on the important aspects and providing a working prototype of the key features.

## Conclusion

While the project is unfinished, I am proud of the work that was accomplished under time pressure. I hope to receive feedback on the parts that were done well.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback on my approach and implementation, especially concerning the areas I couldn't finish within the 48 hours. Criticism and suggestions for improvement are appreciated!
